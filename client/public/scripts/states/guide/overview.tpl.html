                <h1>Welcome to Simple Yacht Jobs</h1>

                <p class="md-body-2" flex-gt-md="70">Finding marine industry work and crew should be simple and easy. Our goal is to connect people. The yachting, marine industry is a small community with a population about the size of a single town. Yet, we are spread apart across all the oceans of the Earth. Nonetheless, we reconnect with each other in Nantucket during the summer and then again six months later when you anchor 100 yards from me in St. Barts, 1,450 nautical miles from where we last met.</p>

                <p class="md-body-1" flex-gt-md="70">Equally as important as finding the best qualified crew or employee is the current physical location of human resources. Quite often a yacht will happily flew qualified crew to join their team in Saint Martin or Fiji. However, it would be helpful for a yacht whose chef just caught the flu a day before a charter to know if a qualified person is already close by on St. Johns, for a yacht broker in Jupiter or Ft. Meyers to know a firm in Fort Lauderdale is growing in size about to hire a employee with his skills, or for a retired yacht captain living in Falmouth, MA who wants to work part time to know a marina Hyannis is hiring. We also want to encourage everyone looking for only daywork to create a profile too.</p>

                <p class="md-body-1" flex-gt-md="70">The foundation of Simple Yacht Jobs is location, location, location. We do not just ask everybody to state their location from a drop down list of a handful of cities each in frequented cruising ground, we geocode every location of crew, employee, and job so users searching for crew, employees, and jobs can leverage the state of the art proximity location search engine.</p>

                <p class="md-body-1" flex-gt-md="70">But, why does this app not have a single map? We don't need maps. Most people accessing this app will either be using a mobile phone or will be in an isolated region with limited internet access. During development we decided not send huge amounts of map data (or, massive images and video which don't add useful value). Instead just tell us where you are and we will find either the closest crew and employees or closest jobs from you and their distance.</p>

                <p class="md-body-1" flex-gt-md="70">Some of the code Simple Yacht Jobs uses is developed by Google including <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> and <a href="https://material.angularjs.org/latest/">Angular Material Design.</a> Our lightning fast server has been built on top of <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a> with <a href="https://expressjs.com/">Express.js</a> and <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/">MongoDB</a> which powers the geolocation database.</p>
