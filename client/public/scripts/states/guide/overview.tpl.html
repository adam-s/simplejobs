            <p class="md-body-2" flex-gt-sm="80">The yacht industry is a very small community the size of a single medium town spread across the Earth and oceans. As we travel from the Mediterranean and New England to the Caribbean across thousands of nautical miles of open space we continuously keep running into each other. I might be at the same dock as you in Halifax Harbor in July, six months later I see you at Foxy's on Jost Van Dyke, and yet after another year passes I see you pulling into the dock on Spanish Cay on a different yacht. We were the only yacht there for a week in November until you arrived! What's the chance? It's a small world and we are not just in Palma de Mallorca, Newport, Fort Lauderdale, St. Thomas, and St. Martin; we are everywhere and we are one community. </p>

            <p class="md-body-1" flex-gt-sm="66">Yachting has a lot of turnover. It is not a bad thing. A person might do daywork for only one day or a week, a two week freelance charter as the chef, a several week Atlantic crossing from the Mediterranean to the Caribbean, or just one season in the New England. Within this small dispersed yachting community, there are qualified and talented crew and employees everywhere. <span class="md-body-2">This app's single purpose is to make it as simple and easy for yacht related businesses, yacht industry professionals, yacht owners, captains, and crew who are close to each other, one town or island apart, to find each other.</span></p>

            <p class="md-body-1 module" flex-gt-sm="66">I wanted to do a location proximity search on a crew placement website for yacht chef jobs near my location and didn't use that technology. They didn't have the technology. So I built an app that does does use it. This app makes a search index of job, crew, and employee locations. The user can use an autocomplete widget to geocode their location to search for the closest jobs, crew, and employees. Simple!</p>
