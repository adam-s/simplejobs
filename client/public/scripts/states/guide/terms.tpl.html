            <h4 class="md-title">Introduction</h4>

            <p class="md-body-1">By using this site you consent to our collection and use of your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy. If we change our privacy policies and procedures, we will post those changes on this site to keep you aware of what information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances we may disclose it.</p>
            <h4 class="md-title">What information do we collect</h4>
            <div>
                <p class="md-body-1">When you visit our website you may provide us with two types of information: personal information you knowingly choose to disclose that is collected on an individual basis and website use information collected automatically as you and others browse our website.</p>
            </div>
            <h4 class="md-title">Personal information you knowingly choose to provide</h4>
            <p class="md-body-1">If you choose to fill out a profile you will provide us information about yourself, your firm, yacht, or company which includes your name, company name, email, phone number, and many other items related to the job or your work experience. You will also share an uploaded resume.</p>
            <p class="md-body-1">All information provided to job listings or resume profile is available for any registered user to access. You can deactivate each job listing and resume profile. This will hide it from all users except administrators.</p>
            <h4 class="md-title">Website user information</h4>
            <p class="md-body-1">Similar to other commercial websites, our website utilizes a standard technology called “cookies” (see explanation below, “What Are Cookies?”) and Web server logs (“Log Files”) and Google Analytics to collect information about how our website is used. Information gathered through cookies, Google Analytics and Web server logs may include the date and time of visits, the pages viewed, time spent at our website, and the websites visited just before and just after our website. We, our advertisers and ad serving companies may also use small pieces of code called “web beacons” or “clear gifs” to determine which advertisements and promotions users have seen and how users responded to them. Personally identifiable information is not stored in these cookies, web beacons, or clear gifs. We use a third-party tracking service, Google Analytics, that uses cookies and log files to track non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our site in the aggregate, usage and volume statistic to help us better understand the needs of our visitors.</p>
            <h4 class="md-title">How do we use the information that you provide to us?</h4>
            <p class="md-body-1">Broadly speaking, we use personal information for purposes of administering and expanding our business activities, providing customer service and making available other products and services to our clients and prospective clients. Occasionally, we also use the information we collect to notify you about important changes to our website, new services and special offers we think you will find valuable.</p>
            <h4 class="md-title">What are cookies?</h4>
            <p class="md-body-1">A cookie is a very small text document, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier. When you visit a website, that site’s computer asks your computer for permission to store this file in a part of your hard drive specifically designated for cookies. Each website can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser’s preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a website to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites. Some of our business partners (e.g., advertisers) use cookies that originate from their sites. We have no access or control over those cookies.</p>
            <h4 class="md-title">How do we use information we collect from cookies?</h4>
            <p class="md-body-1">As you use this website, the site uses its cookies to differentiate you from other users. In some cases, we also use cookies to prevent you from seeing unnecessary advertisements or requiring you to log in more than is necessary for security. Cookies, in conjunction with our web server’s log files, allow us to calculate the aggregate number of people visiting this site and which parts of the site are most popular. This helps us gather feedback in order to constantly improve this site and better serve our customers. Cookies do not allow us to gather any personal information about you and we do not generally store any personal information that you provided to us in your cookies.</p>

            <p class="md-body-1">
